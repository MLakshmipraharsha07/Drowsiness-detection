# Drowsiness Detection Alert Simulator ðŸš—

### Introduction
+ The objective of this project is to build a drowsiness detection alert system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for some time. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
+ This drowsiness detection alert system is a safety alarm that alerts the driver whenever he feels drowsy.
+ The eyes movement of the driver is monitored through a webcam and whenever the driver feels asleep or closes eye then it alerts the driver with the help of a loud alarm. Thus, preventing from any accidents from happening.
+ The simulator can detect the drowsiness of a person with and without glasses.
+ It is very robust as it can detect during dim and dark light conditions.

### Technology Used
+ Visual Studio Codes
+ Python Programming Language

### Architecture

![design](https://github.com/MLakshmipraharsha07/Drowsiness-detection/assets/98521185/525cdfca-1e57-4afc-b47c-8f87f7d80f71)

### Output Screenshots
+ To test the simulator robustness we have tested it under dark lighting conditions with glasses
+ When the score is above 5 then it produces an alarm sound which indicates that the person is sleeping.
